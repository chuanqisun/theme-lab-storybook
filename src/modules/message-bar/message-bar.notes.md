1. The html in the multi message demo is not accessible. Please consult SME for implementation.
2. For demo purposes, the slide duration is 3 seconds. In production, use 5 seconds at least to provide more reading time.
3. Animation should be paused once user hovers on the bar. This behavior is not demoed here.
4. Animation should be killed once user uses keyboard/mouse to manually go to next/previous slide. This behavior is not demoed here.
5. The message bar supports a maximum of 2 lines of text. Additional content will be cropped.
